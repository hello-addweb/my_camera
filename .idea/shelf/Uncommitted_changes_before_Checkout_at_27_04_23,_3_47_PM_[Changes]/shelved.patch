They are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when\n  # adding or updating assets for this project.\n  plugin:\n    platforms:\n      android:\n        package: com.search.my_camera\n        pluginClass: MyCameraPlugin\n      ios:\n        pluginClass: MyCameraPlugin\n\n\n  # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:\n  # assets:\n  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg\n  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg\n  #\n  # For details regarding assets in packages, see\n  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages\n  #\n  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific \"variants\", see\n  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.\n\n  # To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,\n  # in this \"flutter\" section.
